However, you can also set it manually by passing it as a second parameter to parallelize (e.g. sc.parallelize(data, 10)).

    "Some notes on reading files with Spark:\n",
    "\n",
    "If using a path on the local filesystem, the file must also be accessible at the same path on worker nodes. Either copy the file to all workers or use a network-mounted shared file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of Spark’s file-based input methods, including textFile, support running on directories, compressed files, and wildcards as well. For example, you can use `textFile(\"/my/directory\")`, `textFile(\"/my/directory/*.txt\")`, and `textFile(\"/my/directory/*.gz\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The textFile method also takes an optional second argument for controlling the number of partitions of the file. By default, Spark creates one partition for each block of the file (blocks being 128MB by default in HDFS), but you can also ask for a higher number of partitions by passing a larger value. Note that you cannot have fewer partitions than blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from text files, Spark’s Scala API also supports several other data formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "SparkContext.wholeTextFiles lets you read a directory containing multiple small text files, and returns each of them as (filename, content) pairs. This is in contrast with textFile, which would return one record per line in each file. Partitioning is determined by data locality which, in some cases, may result in too few partitions. For those cases, wholeTextFiles provides an optional second argument for controlling the minimal number of partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SequenceFiles, use SparkContext’s sequenceFile[K, V] method where K and V are the types of key and values in the file. These should be subclasses of Hadoop’s Writable interface, like IntWritable and Text. In addition, Spark allows you to specify native types for a few common Writables; for example, sequenceFile[Int, String] will automatically read IntWritables and Texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other Hadoop InputFormats, you can use the SparkContext.hadoopRDD method, which takes an arbitrary JobConf and input format class, key class and value class. Set these the same way you would for a Hadoop job with your input source. You can also use SparkContext.newAPIHadoopRDD for InputFormats based on the “new” MapReduce API (org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce).\n",

    "## RDD Operations\n",
    "RDDs support two types of operations: transformations, which create a new dataset from an existing one, and actions, which return a value to the driver program after running a computation on the dataset. For example, map is a transformation that passes each dataset element through a function and returns a new RDD representing the results. On the other hand, reduce is an action that aggregates all the elements of the RDD using some function and returns the final result to the driver program (although there is also a parallel reduceByKey that returns a distributed dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "All transformations in Spark are lazy, in that they do not compute their results right away. Instead, they just remember the transformations applied to some base dataset (e.g. a file). The transformations are only computed when an action requires a result to be returned to the driver program. This design enables Spark to run more efficiently. For example, we can realize that a dataset created through map will be used in a reduce and return only the result of the reduce to the driver, rather than the larger mapped dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, each transformed RDD may be recomputed each time you run an action on it. However, you may also persist an RDD in memory using the persist (or cache) method, in which case Spark will keep the elements around on the cluster for much faster access the next time you query it. There is also support for persisting RDDs on disk, or replicated across multiple nodes.\n",

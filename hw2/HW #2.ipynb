    "4 subtasks:\n",
    "+ (20pt) In social feedback data, calculate the average popularity of each news by hour, and by day, respectively\n",
    "+ (20pt) In news data, calculate the sum and average sentiment score of each topic, respectively\n",
    "+ (30pt) In news data, count the words in two fields: ‘Title’ and ‘Headline’ respectively, and list the most frequent words according to the term frequency in descending order, in total, per day, and per topic, respectively\n",
    "+ (30pt) From the previous subtask, for the top-100 frequent words per topic in titles and headlines, calculate their co-occurrence matrices (100x100), respectively. Each entry in the matrix will contain the co-occurrence frequency in all news titles and headlines, respectively\n",
